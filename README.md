vimconf
=======

My personal Vim configuration.

Useable for a wide array of tasks, easy to install and has an explained .vimrc.  
All required files to get it up and running is included. Fonts aswell. 

The install process heavily relies upon the genious plugin manager Vundle, thus it is included. It doesn't matter if it's outdated, it'll update itself.

### Installation
To install simply download, copy .vim and .vimrc to your home-folder, open an empty file with Vim and run this to install (same goes for updating)

    :BundleInstall

See ![Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle) for more information on how to use it.
