vimconf
=======

My Vim configuration.

Easy to install, explained .vimrc and usable for a wide array of tasks.  
All required files to get it up and running is included. Fonts aswell. 

The install process heavily relies upon the genius plugin manager Vundle, 
thus it is included.  
It doesn't matter if it's outdated, it'll update itself.

### Installation
To install simply download and copy all the files to your home-folder, 
open an empty file with Vim and run this to install.  
It's the same command for updating.  

    :BundleInstall

See [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle) for more information on how 
to use it.

**Note**: This configuration uses 'fancy' glyphs for 
[Powerline](https://github.com/Lokaltog/vim-powerline) and therefore requires 
a patched font for it to work. Either disable this or use an appropriate font.  
See the docs for more information.
